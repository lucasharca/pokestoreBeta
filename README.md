## PokeStore
You can preview this app at: https://pokestore-br.herokuapp.com/
Heroku needs 10 seconds do "wake up", if the page doesn't load wait 1 minute and try reloading.

In this project I created an online store example using pokémon. This particular store only contains fire type pokémon.
The tech used is ReactJS, together with pokeAPI as a source of pokémon data.

The app is straight foward. You select the pokémon you want from a list and add it to cart, once you have everything you want you can checkout, that will clear the cart and show a modal message.

The page is 100% responsive, looking and working great on any screen size with all the functions and clean layout.

This app uses Redux for data storage
